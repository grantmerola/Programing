Filesystems are all around us they permeate our computing lives, almost always invisible. Like all hidden infrastructure they are essential to the modern functioning of society. Although filesystems play such an important role they are often bundled up with conversations about Operating Systems(OS). Filesystems *are* tightly coupled with operating systems, often in diagrams they are [shown](http://www.tldp.org/LDP/sag/html/overview-kernel.png) as part of the Kernel along with things like the Process, Network and Memory Mangers, however filesystems are(on most systems) interchangeable. Due to the modular nature of many OSs the filesystem can be swapped out depending on the users need and wants.
